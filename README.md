# Berkeley Quantum Synthesis Toolkit (BQSKit)

The Berkeley Quantum Synthesis Toolkit (BQSKit) \[bis â€¢ kit\] is a powerful
and portable quantum compiler framework. It can be used with ease to compile
quantum programs to efficient physical circuits for any QPU.

## Installation

BQSKit is available for Python 3.8+ on Linux, macOS, and Windows. BQSKit
and its dependencies are listed on the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org),
and as such, pip can easily install it:

```sh
pip install bqskit
```

## Basic Usage

A standard BQSKit workflow loads a program into the framework, models the
target QPU, compiles the program, and exports the resulting circuit. The
below example uses BQSKit to optimize an input circuit provided by a qasm
file:

```python
from bqskit import compile, Circuit

# Load a circuit from QASM
circuit = Circuit.from_file("input.qasm")

# Compile the circuit
compiled_circuit = compile(circuit)

# Save output as QASM
compiled_circuit.save("output.qasm")
```

To learn more about BQSKit, follow the
[tutorial series](https://github.com/BQSKit/bqskit-tutorial/) or refer to
the [documentation](https://bqskit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## How to Cite

You can use the [software disclosure](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1785933)
to cite the BQSKit package.

Additionally, if you used or extended a specific algorithm, you should cite
that individually. BQSKit passes will include a relevant reference in
their documentation.

## Installation and Setup

To use BQSKIT with its dependencies, including `pymetis` for graph partitioning and `kahypar` for hypergraph partitioning, follow these steps to set up the environment. These instructions assume you have a compatible system (Linux, macOS, or Windows with WSL).

### Prerequisites
- **Miniconda**: Install Miniconda to manage the Python environment. Download it from [https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) and follow the installation instructions for your platform.
- **Git**: Required to clone or work with the repository (if applicable).

### Setting Up the Environment
The recommended way to install dependencies is using Conda with the provided `environment.yml` file, which ensures compatibility with `pymetis` (installed via Conda-Forge) and `kahypar` (installed via PyPI).

#### Step 1: Clone or Extract the Project
If you received this as a Git repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd bqskit

#### Step 2: Create the Environment
#Use the environment.yml file to recreate the exact environment:
conda env create -f environment.yml

"""
This sets up a Conda environment named pymetis_env with Python 3.11 and all required packages.

The contents of environment.yml are:
"""
name: pymetis_env
channels:
  - conda-forge
  - defaults
dependencies:
  - python=3.11
  - numpy>=1.26.0
  - scipy>=1.12.0
  - lark>=1.2.2
  - pymetis>=2022.1
  - pip
  - pip:
    - kahypar>=1.0
    - bqskitrs>=0.4.1
    - dill>=0.3.9
    - typing_extensions>=4.12.2

### Step 3: Activate the Environment
#Activate the environment to use it:
conda activate pymetis_env

### Step 4: Install BQSKIT
# Install the local bqskit package in editable mode:
pip install -e .

###Step 5: Verify Installation
#Test that everything is set up:

python -c "import bqskit, pymetis, kahypar; print('BQSKIT and dependencies installed successfully')"

"""
Alternative Setup with pip
If you prefer not to use Conda or encounter issues:

Create a virtual environment

"""
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/WSL/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows CMD

#Install dependencies from requirements.txt:
pip install -r requirements.txt

#Install BQSKIT:Install BQSKIT:
pip install .

#Note: pymetis may require a compatible Python version (e.g., <=3.11) and a C++ compiler (e.g., g++). On Ubuntu, install build tools with:
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y build-essential g++ cmake

"""

This method might not match the exact Conda-Forge pymetis version (2023.1.1) used in development.

Dependencies
Core BQSKIT Dependencies: numpy, scipy, lark, bqskitrs, dill, typing_extensions.
Partitioning Tools:
pymetis (2023.1.1 via Conda-Forge): Graph partitioning.
kahypar (1.3.5 via PyPI): Hypergraph partitioning.
See requirements.txt for version details if using the pip method.
